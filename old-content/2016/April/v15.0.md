# API v15.0 Release Notes:

Released to Prod on Friday, April 15th, 2016 at 8 PM CST.

## Changelog
- We've fixed a bug where, if you [searched a list](https://devcenter.ordercloud.io/docs#XP) on XP, you sometimes got duplicate results.
- We've fixed a bug where, if you are an Admin User, you couldn't update the line items on an order for a Buyer User. This is an uncommon scenario, as generally an Admin user would impersonate a Buyer User to make an order on behalf of the Buyer user, but some integrations use an Admin User directly.
