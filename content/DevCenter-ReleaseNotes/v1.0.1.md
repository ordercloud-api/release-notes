## Release Notes

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve developer experience, we've made some changes to [OrderCloud DevCenter](https://developer.ordercloud.io/). Most of the changes are under the hood, but we think you'll appreciate the following:

- We've dusted off the styling for DevCenter in general. It should be mildly faster to respond and more consistant in its design. We also fixed a bunch of nagging little bugs.

- We've heard the cry for [Documentation](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation) improvements, and we hope you like this initial overhaul!
    + Our collection of [Platform Guides](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation/platform-guides) should be entirely *correct* and *up to date*. 
    + We've **removed** Use Case Guides, and are currently considering how to better provide this kind of buisness use case information going forward. 
    + One big bug we fixed was the around the [Platform Guide](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation/platform-guides) section links. These should be much more helpful now when sharing documentation references with your team.
    + We've made improvements to the [Documentation](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation) loading times. We know this has been a real pain point, but load times should be noticiably improved.

- In the [OrderCloud Dashboard](https://developer.ordercloud.io/dashboard), we've fixed various bugs, particularly around Buyer and Seller Org managment, and Integrations. 
    + We've also updated the Integrations available to reflect our current platform offerings. 
    + Notably, *Avalara* is not a platform option anymore. We've found Avalara to be an Integration that needs a little more customization than we can currently allow in our our of the box integrations -- if you would like to know more about setting up Avalara as a custom integration, please talk to us [in Slack](https://ordercloudapi.slack.com). 
    + We have reviewed existing Avalara configurations, and if you were/are using it, your configuration still exists. However, you should contact us to discuss migrating to a custom integration.
    + On Webhooks, we've added the ability to configure **pre-webhook** functionality. These pre-webhooks allow you to do useful things like verify that order information is correct before the order is submitted. Another option that we find handy is allowing a user to be assigned particular assignments on User creation. 
    + Also on webhooks, we've fixed some bugs around updating an existing configuration. No more need to delete and recreate your configurations!

- In the [OrderCloud Console](https://developer.ordercloud.io/console), documentation links have been fixed, and added more lock boxes to make console use easier.
- You can now use multiple [filters](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation/platform-guides/basic-api-features/filtering) in the Console on API List endpoints! A supported API feature, we've now added support for it in the DevCenter. 

## URL Changes

As part of the DevCenter update, we've changed up some of the DevCenter URLS. Please take note and update bookmarks accordingly.
