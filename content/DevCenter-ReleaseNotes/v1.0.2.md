Title: DevCenter 1.0.2 Release Candidate Notes
Category: DevCenter Release Notes
Tags: DevCenter
Slug: ordercloud-devcenter-v1.0.2
Authors: Kate Reeher

> Release Scheduled for 7:30 PM Central on February 15th, 2018.

## Bug Fixes

- Removed `DELETE` confirmation modals from the Console.
- We've fixed some issues with minification, so initial page load times should be improved, and that eternal load indicator on some guides will be gone as well.
- Two load indicators on "Open in API Console" fixed.

## Features

- We changed the `Order.Direction` parameter to a dropdown rather than a text box, as Direction only ever has two valid values -- `Incoming` and `Outgoing`.
- In [API 1.0.70]({filename}../API-ReleaseNotes/v1.0.70.md) we changed `Catalogs` to no longer allow deletion of a default catalog for a buyer. We updated DevCenter to reflect this more clearly.
