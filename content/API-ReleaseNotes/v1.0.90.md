## Summary

Several bug fixes and performance improvements.

## Bug Fixes & Performance Improvements

- Previously, the [Create/Patch/Update User](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation/api-reference/Buyers/Users/Create) webhooks were passing the user's password, if present, in the clear. This has now been redacted, as is our policy across the board. 
- We have make some changes to our product cache loading in order to improve performance for product listing and related endpoints. This affects non-Search 2.0 enabled buyers only.
- For Search 2.0 enabled buyers, we did some performance improvements around `GET me/products`, specifically around improving performance on searches that use XP extensively.
