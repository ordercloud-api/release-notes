## New Features
- We added two new Mandrill template variables: `ShipmentItems` and `DateShipped`

## Bug Fixes
- We fixed an issue where some list endpoints would fail intermittently with a 409 error. This included Me Categories, and Me Products, among others.
- We fixed an issue where the Rules Engine was throwing a 500 if you tried to create a rule with `order.xp` in either of the expressions.
