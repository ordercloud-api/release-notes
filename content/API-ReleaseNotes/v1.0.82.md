## Summary

This release consisted largely of some enhancements to the Search 2.0 beta, based on internal beta group feedback. 

### Updates

#### Search 2.0 Beta: Fuzziness

*What Is It?*

Haha, no, we did not add adorable soft kittens to the search results. Instead, we added [fuzzy matching](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzziness.html).  
    
*Why Is It Important?* Search 2.0 already looks for natural English-language stemming, but fuzzy search allows for common errors as well. Did your user search for "elctric" when they meant "electric"? Adding fuzzy matches improves the quality of the search results.

*How Does This Affect Me?* Search 2.0 enabled applications should see some improved search results, particularly around misspellings and [common errors](https://www.livescience.com/18392-reading-jumbled-words.html).

#### Search 2.0 Beta: Changes to Facet Lists' Meta Info

*What Is It?* We made some changes to the way that Facet Meta information is presented in the resulting JSON object from a `me/products` call in a Search 2.0 enabled application.
    
*Why Is It Important?* These changes were made after some feedback from our internal beta group, who found that `Facet.ID` was unhelpful, but knowing `Facet.XpPath` would be helpful when using these results to build Faceted Navigation.

*How Does This Affect Me?* You will see the following Meta body if using Facets with Search 2.0 in your application:

```
{
    "Meta": {
      "Facets": [
        {
          "Name": "colors.spring",
          "XpPath": "colors.spring",
          "Values": [
            {
              "Value": "680947636313",
              "Count": 20
            },
            {
              "Value": "107259688976",
              "Count": 16
            }
          ],
          "xp": {}
        },
        {
          "Name": "job",
          "XpPath": "job",
          "Values": [
            {
              "Value": "107259688976",
              "Count": 16
            }
          ],
          "xp": {}
        }
      ]
    }
```

Additionally, Facets themselves now carry their own XP information, just in case.

### Bug Fixes

- Facets were not showing up in the Swagger Spec
- We now throw a better error if a user attempts to access Search 2.0 endpoints from an application that does not have Search 2.0 enabled.
