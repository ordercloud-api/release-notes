## New Features

- You can no longer accidentally delete a buyer's default catalog! If you attempt to delete a catalog that happens to be the default catalog for one or more buyers, you'll get an error and a list of buyers.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed some character lengths around DevCenter User's Account information. Everything should now politely error should you attempt to insert a small poem rather than your company name. 
- We've also improved some of the error handling around object creation with bad datetime strings. 
- Minor error handling improvements around attempts at URL unfriendly object IDs.
- We've made some enhancements around our indexing performance.
