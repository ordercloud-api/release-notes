Released to Prod on Sunday, May 7th, 2017.

## New Features
- Improved performance for `me/categories` and `me/product` lists.
- We've added some more debug information to OpenConnectID errors.

## Bug Fixes

- Previously, we required `CatalogAdmin` and `ProductAdmin` to list Catalog and Product assignments, respectively. This is now changed to be consistant with other assignment listing role checks so that the user only needs `CatalogReader` / `ProductReader`.
- Now, if you patch a line item unit price with either `null` or an empty string, the price will be recalculated.
- No more 500 error when you try to delete a category with children.
- Generating variant IDs for Spec Option IDs that have blank spaces in their values will no longer result in IDs with spaces. Now all spaces are translated as -.
- Trying to patch `ShipWeight`/`Height`/`Width`/`Length` with a string no longer throws an error.
- Trying to patch a spec option with an invalid ID returns a 404 now.
