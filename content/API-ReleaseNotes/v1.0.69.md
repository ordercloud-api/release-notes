## Bug Fixes

- Previously, we had some inconsistent logic about when we evaluated [Promotions](https://documentation.ordercloud.io/api-reference#Promotions) on an order. Sometimes, this would lead to a submitted order suddenly having an invalid promotion, potentially changing the order total. 
As we want to allow a historical record of promotions at the time of order submit, we have now limited promotion evaluation to only orders whose status is **unsubmitted** or **awaiting approval**.
