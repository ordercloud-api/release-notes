Planned to be released to Prod on Friday, June 16th, 2017 at 7:30 PM CST.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a second approval or decline of an order would return a 409 error


## New Features

- If a default `ShipFrom` address exists on a product, the `shipFromAddress` on a line item containing that product is now inherited on line item create, not order submit. This allows shipping to be more easily calculated.
- You can now filter lists with comparative operands `>=` and `=<`, as well as `>`, `<`, `=`, and `!`
- All approvals are now listed in an order's approval history, not just the final one.
