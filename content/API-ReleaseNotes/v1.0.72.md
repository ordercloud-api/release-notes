## New Features

Previously, if you filtered a list by an xp, it only cared about items in that list that had that xp. This meant that negative filters, such as `xp.Color=!Blue`, for example, would only return other items *with* `xp.Color` but where `xp.Color` was not blue. If an item didn't have `xp.Color` at all, it would not be returned in the filtered list.

Now, xp filters don't just look for the specifified xp and filter down from there. Instead, a filter of `xp.Color=!Blue` will return all items with `xp.Color` where the color isn't blue, *but also* any items without `xp.Color` at all.
