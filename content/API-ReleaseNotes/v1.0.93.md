Planned to be Released to Production on Monday, February 11th, 2019.

## Bugs

- We had a couple of issues where, if an admin user updated something on the Seller side, the change was not immediately reflected when a buyer user used the buyer (`me`) endpoints. This has now been resolved.
    + Price Schedules was affected, but prices should be reflected in buyer endpoints much more quickly.
    + Product Inventory Quantity was also affected, but should be fixed.
- The maximum results that List calls can return on one page is 100. (`PageSize=100`) However, we realized we had a couple endpoints that were allowing 1000 results per page. We have closed this loophole, particularly for GET `v1/products/assignments`. 

## Features

- We did some back end refactoring of Search 2.0 to improve performance and reliability, particularly around the use of complicated logic filters for values.
