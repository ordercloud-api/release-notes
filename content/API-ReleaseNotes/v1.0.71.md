## Bug Fixes

- We fixed an issue where Admin Address XP were not being correctly indexed retroactively.
- We fixed an issue with filtering a list of Products by the `SpecCount` field -- the list will now be correctly returned if the `SpecCount` is 0.
- We have solved an issue with Spending Accounts where duplicate Redemption Codes could be created on different Spending Accounts in the same Buyer. Now Spending Accounts cannot be made with any Redemption Code that is already in use within the Buyer. (Don't worry about existing applications you may have; there were no dupes in our databases at time of the fix.)
