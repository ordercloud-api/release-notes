Released to Production February 1st, 2019.

Release consisted of a bug fix for Search 2.0 customers. We discovered that filter values using Search 2.0 were inadvertently case-sensitive. This has now been changed.

`me/products?Description|Name=*vol*` will now return products with VOL, Vol, or any other case permutation in the Product Description or Product Name. 

As this is a Search 2.0 related item, you will only see a different if your application is using Search 2.0. Search 2.0 is only enabled on the `me/products` endpoint as well. 

Filter *names* continue to be case-sensitive, as they are properties of the product. Using `me/products?description|name=*vol*` will return nothing, as those are not properties.
