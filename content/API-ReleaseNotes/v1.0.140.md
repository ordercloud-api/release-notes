This release adds the same Elasticsearch-driven [Premium Search features](https://ordercloud.io/intro-to-premium-search/) to `GET v1/products` that are currently only available in `GET v1/me/products`. Initially, this will only affect a small group of beta customers, but we will be rolling it out to everyone in the coming days/weeks. **Please review [this blog post](https://ordercloud.io/intro-to-premium-search/) carefully, especially regarding the changes in *search behavior*, as it will now be relevant to "admin" product lists.** Contact Four51 if you have any questions or concerns.
