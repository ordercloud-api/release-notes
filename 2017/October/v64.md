# API v1.0.64 Release Candidate Notes

_Planned to be released to Production on Monday, October 30th, 2017_

## New Features
- We now allow `lineitems` of *unsubmitted* `Orders` to be added to a `Shipment`. This does not apply to the [`ship all` endpoint](http://qa-documentation.ordercloud.io/api-reference#Orders_Ship).
- There is a new endpoint that allows a `buyer user` to be transfered from one buyer to another, within the same organization. Please check out the [documentation](http://qa-documentation.ordercloud.io/api-reference#Users_Move) for further details.
  * please note, this should only be attempted by an `admin user` in a seller application. If a buyer user, even one with `Full Access`, tries this, it will not work as expected.
