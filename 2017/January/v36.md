# API v36 Release Notes 

Released to Production on January 17th, 2017 at 7:30 PM Central.

## New Features
- We've added a new sub-object to the LineItem object. Now, when you list LineItems, you'll see the products that are on the lineitem too. This currently does not include the full price break information.
    *New Line Item Object Example*:
    `    {
      "ID": "6-Ap0yfJ6k2kDxEJhPA4432vjA",
      "ProductID": "Test01",
      "Quantity": 5,
      "DateAdded": "2016-05-19T17:51:46.127+00:00",
      "QuantityShipped": 0,
      "UnitPrice": null,
      "LineTotal": 0,
      "CostCenter": null,
      "DateNeeded": null,
      "ShippingAccount": null,
      "ShippingAddressID": "2WRMZMDcakaVaoJ6Hf_r1w",
      "ShipFromAddressID": null,
      "Product": {
        "ID": "Test01",
        "Name": "Test01",
        "Description": "Test01 Lorem Ipsum",
        "QuantityMultiplier": 1,
        "ShipWeight": 1,
        "ShipHeight": null,
        "ShipWidth": null,
        "ShipLength": null,
        "xp": {
          "test": false
        }
      }`


### Shipping Rates Integration
- We've added UPS account configuration options to the Shipping Rates integration.
- We've added the option to adjust (as an admin) rates that are displayed to users by either a percentage or a flat rate, either at a global or carrier level.
- You can now add a manual shipper as well, to account for another kind of shipper than USPS or UPS.

### Authorize.net
- We're storing the partial card number for single use card payments in the Payment object's XP, so it can be used in the refund transaction.


## Bug Fixes
- You can't see expired Spending Accounts in the User Perspective Spending Account list, and you can't use one to make a new payment either.
- You can create a payment that exceeds the Spending Account balance if and only if the Spending Account Assignment for the relevant party has `AllowExceed` set to `true`.
- Speaking of price schedules, you can now set a minimum quantity, even when the quantity is not restricted to particular breaks. So, you can now say someone has to order *at least* 5 products, but they don't have to order only 10, 20, or 30, for example.
- A buyer user without elevated permissions cannot cancel their completed orders. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و

### Mandrill Integration
- We've fixed an issue with the Date Submitted variable for Orders not getting pulled into Mandrill email templates properly.

### Authorize.net
- We've fixed the partial UpdateCreditCard to stop overwriting the CardholderName with `null`.
