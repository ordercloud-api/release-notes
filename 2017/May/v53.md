# API v1.0.53 Release Candidate Notes:

Released to Production on Monday, May 15th, 2017 at 7:30pm CST.


## Bug Fixes

- Buyer Users with the `ShipmentAdmin` role can now properly create shipments.
- We now properly throw a 409 error if you try to delete an admin user who is being used as the `DefaultUserContextID` for an org.
- Listing me/Shipments performance should be noticeably improved on large lists.
- Initial emails for Approvals message senders were not being sent.

## New Features

- Developers who use the OIDC flow for authentication will now be able to dynamically route their users to specific parts of their app after authentication. To do so, add `appstartpath=<extrapath>` to the query on ocrplogin.
    * Example: `https://nodomain.com/myapp{2}?token={0}&idt={1}`
    * The {2} can go anywhere in the appstart url.
