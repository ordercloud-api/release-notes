# API v1.0.60 Release Notes:

Released to Prod on Tuesday, July 18th, 2017 at 7:30 PM CST.

## New Features

- We've added a description field to Message Senders. 
- We moved the platform Message Sender code to a public repo, so that developers can use it to create custom Message Senders. [Message Sender on GitHub](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/MessageSender)
    * Please note, **we have not yet enabled custom message senders in DevCenter**. You can start to develop one but can't configure one just yet to be used. This will be available in DevCenter in the near future.
- We've improved logging around Message Senders.

## Bugs Fixed

- We fixed an issue that was blocking New User Invite emails.
